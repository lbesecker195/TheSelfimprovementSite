## Classic Ginger Turmeric Wellness Shot

### Ingredients (Makes 2–3 shots)
- 2 inches fresh ginger root (about 2–3 tbsp when juiced or grated)
- 2 inches fresh turmeric root (or 1 tsp ground turmeric)
- 1 medium lemon, juiced
- 1 Tbsp raw honey or maple syrup (optional, for taste)
- 1 pinch black pepper (enhances absorption of turmeric)
- 1–2 Tbsp water (to thin, if needed)

### Instructions
1. **Juice or grate** the ginger and turmeric roots. If you don’t have a juicer, finely grate and squeeze through cheesecloth or a nut milk bag to extract the juice.

3. **Add black pepper** and water, then stir until combined.
4. Pour into shot glasses and take immediately, or store in the fridge for up to 2 days.
